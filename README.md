# Sanaz_Golriz_Portfolio


Here is a brief description of what each file includes: 

1 - RCT_Progress_Monitor.ipynb :
    This is a code written in PYTHON language. It uses SQL querying inside it to extract
    the required tables from the database. It generates plots with useful information that
    generate insight about the outcome of a randomized controlled trial. 

2 - AdaptiveMeshAlgorithm-IDL.ipynb
    This is an object oriented IDL code that finds the best-fitting model to an 
    observed spectra of certain sample of stars using lab based data. The code adopts 
    the dynamic adaptive mesh algorithms to minimize the chi-square value.  


3 - MachineLearning_LogisticRegression.ipynb and MachineLearning_LinearRegression.ipynb 
    They are both written in MATLAB and executed with OCTAVE. Each are designed to 
    find the best fit for the given distribution via minimizing the cost function. 

4 - ImageProcessing.ipynb 
    This code is written in IDL language. The purpose is to find several pieces of a 
    puzzle and glue them back together. These pieces are images of the sky at different
    lattitude and longitudes. The code will scale every pixel, identifies the overlap
    regions and merges them in the most accurate way possible. The the other chunk
    of the code will plot the sample star on top of the new image. 

5 -  HTMLCSS.ipynb
     This contains a chunk of the html code I wrote for my webpage publish.uwo.ca/~sgolriz
     Including the CSS style sheet.
